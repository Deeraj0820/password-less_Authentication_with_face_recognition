password-less_Authentication_with_face_recognition

In this project, we developed a password-less face authentication system using Pythonâ€™s face_recognition library to simplify user access without remembering passwords. The system captures and stores user facial data, allowing for future logins through facial recognition. We designed an intuitive GUI using tkinter, where users can easily register their face and authenticate. This approach provides a secure, user-friendly alternative to traditional password-based authentication.
